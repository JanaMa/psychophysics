This class contains methods that make MATLAB's object orientation slightly 
less sucky (IT REMAINS VERY SUCKY!!)

Inherit this class when defining new classes. Then copy the single-line 
methods 'getfield' and 'setfield' into your new class. Then you have:

Default implementations of get/set e.g.
	obj = set(obj, 'prop_name', value) and value = get(obj, prop_name)
 	By default these just set the appropriate fields in the class or its
	parent,
	but if you implement methods such as get_prop_name and set_prop_name
	it will delegate to those methods.

	You can also delegate to set in the class constructor 
	(TODO: factor out common code for class constructors into this class)

Default subsref and subsasgn -- synonyms for get/set so that instead of
	obj = set(obj, 'prop_name', value) 
you can write
	obj.prop_name = value
	
and instead of
	value = get(obj, 'prop_name')
you can write
	value = obj.prop_name
