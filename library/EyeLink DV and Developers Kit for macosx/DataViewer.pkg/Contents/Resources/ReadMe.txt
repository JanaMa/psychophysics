Fixes were all made in the ViewerProperties.java    * - Added attribute to Viewer Preferences panel -> General, that lets you specific if helper applications should be searched for or not.    * - Added all these to IA report:      IA_FIRST_FIXATION_DURATION      IA_LAST_FIXATION_DURATION      IA_FIRST_RUN_DWELL_TIME      IA_FIRST_RUN_FIXATION_%      IA_FIRST_SACCADE_START_TIME      IA_FIRST_SACCADE_END_TIME      IA_LAST_SACCADE_START_TIME      IA_LAST_SACCADE_END_TIME Version 1.2.452:    * - Added time attribute to InterestArea class. This is used to filter IAs based on the current selected IP.    * - Added two properties to the Filter Viewer properties section:      "Show Interest Areas Pre Interest Period "      "Show Interest Areas Post Interest Period " Version 1.3.0:    * - Added sample output report .    * - Added ability to load a set of messages into an EDF file in the data viewer. This is done by using the "Import Message List" pop-up menu item when a EDF file is selected in the tree view.    * - Added TRIAL_START_TIME variable to fixation, saccade, and IA reports    * - Changed all eye event start and end times in IA report to be relative to trial start instead of absolute    * - Added following variables to IA report:      IA_SECOND_RUN_FIXATION_%      IA_SECOND_RUN_DWELL_TIME      IA_THIRD_RUN_FIXATION_%      IA_THIRD_RUN_DWELL_TIME      IA_FIRST_RUN_START_TIME      IA_SECOND_RUN_START_TIME      IA_THIRD_RUN_START_TIME      IA_FIRST_RUN_END_TIME      IA_SECOND_RUN_END_TIME      IA_THIRD_RUN_END_TIME    * - Added following variables to Trial report:      PUPIL_SIZE_MIN      PUPIL_SIZE_MAX      PUPIL_SIZE_MEAN    * - The user can now delete interest area template from IA template list. If a trial is using the template; the trial IAS is set to the empty template.    * - Added targetPositionString to data loading preference settings. Defines the message text to match on for target position extraction.    * - Added ability to plot accelleration and velocity traces in trial temporal graph view    * - Added target1 and target2 trace buttons to trial temporal graph view    * - In Trial output report, REACTION_TIME variable is retrned as a '.' if the trial does not have an RT end event.    * - Can now load multiple EDF files at once. Each file is processed in sequence.    * - Changed the extension of the output file: if any output report name does not contain a '.xxx', where xxx are any 3 characters, then the file name is appended with a '.txt'.    * - Interest Area Set files now treats any line with a # as a comment    * - If lastDirectoryAccessed is not null, this is now used as starting directory for IAS importing    * - Can now load multiple interest area template files at once;    * - Default IA set directory preference added. Changes to this preference only take effect on files loaded AFTER the change.    * - Default image loading directory now supports image paths that use / or \ as file seperator in message text    * - Can now save the trial playback into a QuickTime .mov file or an uncompressed .AVI file.    * - Fixed a bug which closes an EyeLink Data Viewer session when loading an EDF file with non-latin characters in the file name or path.    * - Can now display non-latin characters contained in the EDF messages when running Data Viewer in the intended non-English operating systems. Version 1.3.35:    * - Added "Auto Select IAS for Trial" property to Output / Analysis Preference Settings. Default is false. If true then trial interest area set association is done automatically by using "Image Name mapping" attribute of Interest Area Set Template in the Data Viewer session.    * - Added "Image Name mapping" field to Interest Area Set Template. If there is a value in the "Image Name mapping" field and "auto Select IAS for Trial" property is true, then this value is used to automatically associate the interest area set to trials. If the last Data Viewer image load command entered in a trial contains a image name that contains the "Image Name mapping" text of the IAS, then the IAS is associated with the trial. Matching is case sensitive. The "Image Name mapping" text does not need to be the full image name in the trial though. If no matching "Image Name mapping" text was found for the trial in any IAS template, then the trial's IAS is set to the default empty IAS template.    * - Added "Maximum Graphics Commands to process" preference in the Data Views->Overlay preference settings. -1 = process all graphics commands; else = process the number of graphics commands specified when creating background image for overlay view.    * - Added "Fit Overlay Image Change to Display" preference in the Data Views->Overlay preference settings. If True, when the background image for a trial is manually changed, the image is scaled to fit the display dimensions for the trial. If false, the image size is not altered and the image is centred on the trial overlay view.    * - Added single trial variable message token command. The default value is "TRIAL_VAR". This command lets the user specify a trial variable and value for the given trial.    * - Added following variables to IA report to represent the average, minimum, and maximum fixation pupil size:      IA_AVERAGE_FIX_PUPIL_SIZE,      IA_MAX_FIX_PUPIL_SIZE,      IA_MIN_FIX_PUPIL_SIZE. Version 1.3.60:    * Added "Duration Based" Interest Period type.    * Added start time and end time offset fields to Interest Period.    * Added IP_START_TIME and IP_END_TIME and IP_DURATION to trial output report. These variables represent EDF time of start end end of active Interest Period.    * Added following variables to IA report for fixation sequence analysis. If used, n columns are output in the report, where n is equal to the number of unique IA ID's in the data viewing session. Column lables are the variable name with "_IA_ID" appended to it, where IA_ID is the ID of the given IA.      	IA_BSA_COUNT defines the number of times a fixation n started in the current row IA and fixation n+fixation_skip_count was in the current column IA.      	IIA_BSA_DURATION defines the sum of fixation durations for fixation n+fixation_skip_count where fixation n started in the current row IA and fixation n+fixation_skip_count was in the current column IA.      If you have lots of interest areas in a trial, including IA_FSA_COUNT and IA_FSA_DURATION in the output report may take a very long time for the Viewer to generate the report.    * Added "Fixation Skip Count" property to Output / Analysis section of preference settings. Default is 1. Can not be less than 1. Defines the number of fixations to skip when looking for the next IA to use in the fixation sequence analysis output variables of the IA report.    * Added the following variables to interest area report for regression analysis:      	IA_SECOND_FIXATION_TIME - time of second fixation in IA, regardless of run      	IA_THIRD_FIXATION_TIME - time of third fixation in IA, regardless of run      	IA_SECOND_FIXATION_DURATION- duration of second fixation in IA, regardless of run      	IA_THIRD_FIXATION_DURATION- duration of third fixation in IA, regardless of run      	IA_SECOND_FIXATION_RUN - index of run that second fixation is in      	IA_THIRD_FIXATION_RUN - index of run that third fixation is in      	IA_FIRST_FIX_PROGRESSIVE - 1 if NO higher IA ID in earlier fixations than first IA fixation; 0 otherwise      	IA_REGRESSION_PATH_DURATION - the summed fixation duration from when the IA is first fixated until the eyes enter a IA with a larger ID than the starting IA.      	IA_REGRESSION_OUT - 0 if IA was not exited to a lower IA ID (to the left in english); 1 if it was      	IA_SELECTIVE_REGRESSION_PATH_DURATION - only includes fixation and refixations of the same IA before the eyes enter an IA with a larger ID      	IA_REGRESSION_IN - 0 if IA was not entered from a higher IA ID (from the right in english); 1 if it was      	IA_REGRESSION_OUT_COUNT - number of times IA was exited to a lower IA ID (to the left in english);      	IA_REGRESSION_IN_COUNT - number of times IA was entered from a higher IA ID (from the left in english);    * Added progress bar for report creation. Cancelling progress bar cancelling report creation (example ).
