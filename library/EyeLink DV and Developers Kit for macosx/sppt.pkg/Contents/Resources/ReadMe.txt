Some support libraries that are used by eyelink_core_graphics library. The only nessary library is gd. However some sdl libraries are given for compatibility reasons. In the upcoming releases this will be removed. 

You will be able to get gd from http://www.boutell.com/gd/ and SDL from http://www.libsdl.org/index.php
