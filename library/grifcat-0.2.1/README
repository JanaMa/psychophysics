grifcat is a simple utility that monitors a Griffin Powermate and spits
out to stdout any state change information.  This can then be used as
input to a program or script that reacts to the button being pressed or
the wheel being turned.

grifcat requires libusb to be installed before compiling

QUICK START

  $ gcc -Wall src/grifcat.c -lusb -o grifcat
  $ sudo ./grifcat
  (commence knob spinning)

INSTALLATION

 $ gcc -Wall src/grifcat.c -lusb -o grifcat
 $ sudo cp grifcat /usr/local/bin

NOTE: You need to have the 'development' version of libusb installed, not
just the runtime libraries.

USAGE

 To see if the tool finds your griffin powermate, run:

 $ sudo grifcat --list

 To get output, just run it w/o any command line parameters:
 
 $ sudo grifcat
0001 801401 BtnUp Cw 0 1 1 1 0 0 0
0002 801401 BtnUp Ccw 0 -1 0 1 1 0 0
0003 801401 BtnDown Nc 1 0 0 1 1 0 1
0004 801401 BtnDown Ccw 1 -1 -1 1 2 0 1
0005 801401 BtnDown Cw 1 1 0 2 2 0 1
0006 801401 BtnUp Nc 0 0 0 2 2 1 1

 The fields are:
   Sequence Number
   Unknown ID sent by powermate
   Text Button State
   Text rotation direction
   Numeric button state (0 = up, 1 = down)
   Numeric direction (-1 = counter-clockwise, 0 = no change, 1 = clockwise)
   Signed short going from -128 to 127 wrapping around
   Clockwise ticks
   Counter clockwise ticks
   Button releases
   Button presses

There's also a 'minimal' mode which only outputs two numbers, button state
and knob turn.  Use the flag --minimal
 
It's that easy.
