* INSTALL *
***********

--------------------
- Choose ubication -
--------------------
	PVMTB can be installed for 1) all users or 2) only some user

e.g.: MATLAB installed under /usr/local/matlab: change to toolboxes
		cd /usr/local/matlab/toolbox

e.g.: Only user joe wants PVMTB
		cd /home/joe/matlab

------------------------
- Decompress and untar -
------------------------
		cp <wherever>/pvmtb.tgz .
		gunzip pvmtb.tgz
		tar xvf pvmtb.tar
		rm pvmtb.tar

Now there is a pvmtb subdirectory.

--------------------------------
- Configuring MATLAB's startup -
--------------------------------
	PVMTB comes with a startupTBpvm.m file

e.g.: MATLAB installed under /usr/local/matlab: change to local
		cd /usr/local/matlab/toolbox/local
		ln -s ../pvmtb/startupTBpvm.m .

	and add these lines to startup.m

	% PVM Toolbox startup M-file, if it exists.
	if exist('startupTBpvm','file')
	    startupTBpvm
	end

e.g.: Onyl user joe wants PVMTB
		cd /home/joe/matlab
		ln -s pvmtb/startupTBpvm.m startup.m

	If user joe already had a startup.m,
	use the method described above,
	editing his startup.m to add startupTMmpi.m

-----------------------------------
- Configuring user's shell script -
-----------------------------------
	PVM requires an environment variable PVM_ROOT

	The PVMTB can use a PVMTB_ROOT environment variable.
If it is not defined but the user has installed PVMTB under
~/matlab/pvmtb, PVMTB uses that location (please see startupTBpvm.m).
This is the preferred option.

e.g.: for bash, add to ~/.bashrc
export                  PVM_ROOT=/usr/local/pvm3
export       PVM_DPATH=$PVM_ROOT/lib/pvmd
export       PVM_ARCH=`$PVM_ROOT/lib/pvmgetarch`
export            PATH=$PVM_ROOT/bin/$PVM_ARCH:$PVM_ROOT/lib:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PVM_ROOT/lib/LINUX
# export    PVMTB_ROOT=$MATLAB_ROOT/toolbox/pvmtb

e.g.: for tcsh, add to ~/.tcshrc
setenv                  PVM_ROOT=/usr/local/pvm3
setenv       PVM_DPATH $PVM_ROOT/lib/pvmd
setenv       PVM_ARCH `$PVM_ROOT/lib/pvmgetarch`
setenv            PATH $PVM_ROOT/bin/"$PVM_ARCH":$PVM_ROOT/lib:$PATH
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $PVM_ROOT/lib/LINUX
# setenv    PVMTB_ROOT $MATLAB_ROOT/toolbox/pvmtb

----------------------------------------
- PVM default configuration (hostfile) -
----------------------------------------
        This step is optional. If you are going to use only
one host (?!?) no hostfile is required. If several hosts are
going to be used, they can be specified each time PVM is
started with pvm_start_pvmd (or under the pvm console), or
their hostnames can be written to the default hostfile,
pvmdefconf.m. Options can also be specified in the hostfile,
like "* ep=<path>" (man pvmd)

	Edit the sample pvmdefconf.m, so that it mentions
the hosts to be pvm_start_pvmd'ed, and put it somewhere
in MATLABPATH

e.g.: for "global" PVMTB install
	cd $MATLAB_ROOT/toolbox/pvmtb
	<edit pvmdefconf.m>
	mv pvmdefconf.m pvm

	In this case, the user is still able to change the
"default" PVM by using pvme_default_config.

e.g.: for "local", personal PVMTB
	cd ~/matlab/pvmtb
	<edit pvmdefconf.m>
	mv pvmdefconf.m ..

	When matlab is started from /matlab, pvmdefconf.m is
found in the current subdir. The user could have several
pvmdefconf.m in several subdirs, each belonging in different
projects. To switch project, the users changes to that
subdir before starting matlab, finding thus its pvmdefconf.m
first.
