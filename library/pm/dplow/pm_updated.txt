The Parallel Matlab Toolbox is based on the Matlab-C interface for PVM in 
DP toolbox 1.4.9. In the DP toolbox this interface is denoted DPLOW for 
low level layer. The following changes have been made to the DPLOW as 
provided in DP toolbox 1.4.9. 

UPDATED M-FILES IN DPLOW
%-----------------------

pvm_getmboxinfo.m
pvme_default_config.m
pvme_upkarray_rest.m


UPDATED C-files in SRC:
%----------------------

m2libpvm.c

  m2pvm_upkint - rewritten and included.
  m2pvm_recv   - interrupt handling revised.
  m2pvm_trecv  - interrupt handling revised.
  m2pvm_getmboxinfo - debugged and included.

m2libpvme.c 
  #define PM added
  handling for defining /tmp directory added
  
  m2pvme_upkarray_rest - handling of Matlab User defined objects added.
  
m2pvm.c
  reorganised - header file added
  m2pvm_upkint activated

m2pvm.h added

pvmeupk.c
  general modifications of internal error messages for debugging
  pvmeupkmatHeadRest - handling Matlab user defined objects added.
  pvme_upkarray_rest - handling Matlab user defined objects added.
  pvmepkmatHeadRest  - handling Matlab user defined objects added.



OTHER C-FILES from DP toolbox is also used with no changes:
%----------------------------------------------------------

unsetenv.c
putenv.c
selectsdtin.c
persistent2.c



Other files emprunted from DP-toolbox but modified: 
%--------------------------------------------------

dpsend.m is now pmsend.m
dprecv.m is now pmrecv.m
dpmatlab.c - major modifications
dpspawn_startup.m - is now pmspawn_startup.m with major modifications


The remaining files of the parallel Matlab toolbox are completely new or
rewritten
