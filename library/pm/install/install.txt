CONFIGURATION

    There are some files that  should be copied or pasted into already
    existing files  in the system.   The first one is  cshrc.stub that
    should be pasted into .cshrc  in the users home directory. If this
    does not exist simply rename the file to .cshrc. The file contains
    a lot of settings accompanied by comments explaining what may need
    to be  changed for the current  system. The user  must verify that
    the contents  of this  file corresponds to  the user's  system and
    Matlab version, etc. If this file is not set up correctly the user
    risk errors at compilation as well as when running the toolbox.

    The files  startup_stub.m and finish_stub.m should  be pasted into
    the user's possibly already  existing startup.m and finish.m files
    respectively. These must  be stored in the user's  Matlab path. If
    these files  do not  exist simply rename  the "stub" files  to the
    respective target filenames and make sure you store them somewhere
    in the user's Matlab path.

    The  last file  needed is  the pvmdefhosts.m.   This  file defines
    which  hosts that  are  part  of the  parallel  Matlab system  and
    available for running Matlab  processes.  The settings and options
    for this file  can be found in the documentation  for PVM. A basic
    setting contains one host name on each line.


COMPILING

    Before running  the toolbox it  must be compiled.  Make  sure that
    the  .cshrc has updated  the environment  variables.  From  the pm
    directory type "make" at the UNIX prompt.  Some warnings may occur
    at compilation but  do not worry about these.   If no errors occur
    the toolbox is ready to be started.
