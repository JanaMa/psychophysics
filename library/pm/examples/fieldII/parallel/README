To open a parallel Matlab session configured for this problem, use
START.M

Then, use PSIM.M to start the simulation.

The dispatcher will execute the function PROBE_INIT.M on each slave process
before starting the actual dispatching.
At each dispatched evaluation the envelope of an RF line will be calculated. 
The RF line is calculated using CREATE_RF.M, and then a Hilbert
transformation yields the envelope, after which the line is saved to file.

When the dispatching has terminated, pmake_img can be used to reassemble the
RF envelope lines and display the resulting simulated sonogram.

The other files are the same as for the sequential solution.
