     ###Concatenate multi-dimensional arrays along the given dimension,
     a ###generalization of cbind().  Arrays must have the same
     dimensions ###except gor the dimension along which the binding
     occurs. Attempts ###to preserve dimnames; if more than one
     argument provides names for ###a dimension, the earlier argument
     takes precedence.  Arrays may ###have different numbers of
     dimensions in which case they are taken ###to have length 1 in all
     training dimensions. Vectors without a dim ###attribute are taken
     to be column vectors.
